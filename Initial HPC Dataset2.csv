Loss,"Hello darkness, my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains Within the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone 'Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people, maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never share No one dared Disturb the sound of silence ""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know Silence like a cancer grows Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you"" But my words like silent raindrops fell And echoed in the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed To the neon god they made And the sign flashed out its warning In the words that it was forming And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets Are written on the subway walls And tenement halls And whispered in the sounds of silence"""

Aspiration,"Something has changed within me Something is not the same I'm through with playing by the rules Of someone else's game Too late for second-guessing Too late to go back to sleep It's time to trust my instincts Close my eyes and leap It's time to try defying gravity I think I'll try defying gravity Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity And you won't bring me down I'm through accepting limits 'Cause someone says they're so Some things I cannot change But till I try, I'll never know Too long I've been afraid of Losing love, I guess I've lost Well, if that's love, it comes at much too high a cost I'd sooner buy defying gravity Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity I think I'll try defying gravity And you won't bring me down Unlimited (unlimited) My future is (my future is) unlimited (unlimited) And I've just had a vision, almost like a prophecy I know, it sounds truly crazy And true, the vision's hazy But I swear, someday I'll be Flying so high (defying gravity) Kiss me goodbye (defying gravity) So if you care to find me Look to the western sky As someone told me lately ""Everyone deserves the chance to fly"" I'm defying gravity And you won't bring me down Bring me down Bring me down"
Aspiration,"Like a small boat On the ocean Sending big waves Into motion Like how a single word Can make a heart open I might only have one match But I can make an explosion And all those things I didn't say Wrecking balls inside my brain I will scream them loud tonight Can you hear my voice this time? This is my fight song Take back my life song Prove I'm alright song My power's turned on Starting right now I'll be strong I'll play my fight song And I don't really care if nobody else believes 'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep Everybody's worried about me In too deep Say I'm in too deep (in too deep) And it's been two years I miss my home But there's a fire burning in my bones Still believe Yeah, I still believe And all those things I didn't say Wrecking balls inside my brain I will scream them loud tonight Can you hear my voice this time? This is my fight song Take back my life song Prove I'm alright song My power's turned on Starting right now I'll be strong I'll play my fight song And I don't really care if nobody else believes 'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me A lot of fight left in me Like a small boat On the ocean Sending big waves Into motion Like how a single word Can make a heart open I might only have one match But I can make an explosion This is my fight song Take back my life song Prove I'm alright song My power's turned on Starting right now I'll be strong (I'll be strong) I'll play my fight song And I don't really care if nobody else believes 'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me Know I've still got a lot of fight left in me"
Aspiration,"I used to think that I could not go on And life was nothing but an awful song But now I know the meaning of true love I'm leaning on the everlasting arms If I can see it, then I can do it If I just believe it, there's nothing to it I believe I can fly I believe I can touch the sky I think about it every night and day Spread my wings and fly away I believe I can soar I see me running through that open door I believe I can fly I believe I can fly I believe I can fly (woo) See I was on the verge of breaking down Sometimes silence can seem so loud There are miracles in life I must achieve But first I know it starts inside of me If I can see it, then I can be it If I just believe it, there's nothing to it I believe I can fly I believe I can touch the sky I think about it every night and day Spread wings and fly away I believe I can soar I see me running through that open door I believe I can fly I believe I can fly I believe I can fly (woo!) Hey, 'cause I believe in you Oh If I can see it (woo!), then I can do it (I can do it) If I just believe it, there's nothing to it (hey) I believe I can fly (woo!) I believe I can touch the sky I think about it every night and day Spread my wings and fly away I believe I can soar I see me running through that open door I believe I can fly (I can fly) I believe I can fly (I can fly) I believe I can fly (I can fly) If I just spread my wings (I can fly) I can fly (I can fly) I can fly (I can fly) I can fly (I can fly) If I just spread my wings (I can fly) I can fly (I can fly, I can fly) Woo (I can fly) Hm-mm... fly, fly, fly"
